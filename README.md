# Implementation 

The website is implemented in GitHub Pages using Jekyll with Minima layout. This repo contains all relevant files and codes required to deploy the website and link it to a custom domain at https://kozodoi.me.

The blog posts and website pages are coded in one of the three formats: `html` files,`ipynb` notebooks,  or `md` markdown pages. The notebooks and markdown posts are converted to `html` with GitHub actions with help of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which allows publishing blog posts as Jupyter notebooks. 

The website includes several customizations, including:
- the dark/light theme toggle
- site-wide search
- customly designed menu pages
- dynamic layout changes depending on the screen size.
